A **Python3** program for collecting information about computer (for the project this will be one machine) **hardware**, **operating systems**, installed **software** and their versions.

App consists of two elements: a **client** part that will provide information about a given machine and the **server** part which stores the data.

Information is stored in .db file database using **SQLite3** module in Python.
Data about system, software and hardware of clients is visible only for administrator in the web interface.

GUI was designed using **Django** framework.

While the program is executing, we can watch the communication between the client and the server in the console.

Communication between the client and the server is **encrypted** to maintain security.
